svn-easy-backup
==============================================================================

svn-easy-backup is a simple tool meant to make backing up multiple subversion
repositories easy and efficient. Most of the tools that exist today are 
overly complex, rely on specific svn backends or filesystems, create too 
many unnecessary files, or otherwise don't fit my needs.

svn-easy-backup generates portable subversion dumpfiles that can be loaded
into nearly any repository. It relies on the little-known fact that 
incremental dumpfiles can simply be /appended/ to an existing dumpfile.
svn-easy-backup creates a full dumpfile on first run, and then continually
appends to that dumpfile. In this way, 100 subversion repositories will only
ever be contained within 100 dumpfiles, no matter how many times the backup
process is run. You'll never again have to waste time combining N files 
*per repository* in just the right order to restore your backup.

svn-easy-backup maintains state from previous backups to ensure dumpfile
integrity. It will refuse to append to a dumpfile that doesn't match 
the previously generated file.

The resulting dumpfiles can easily be backed up via tools such as rsync.
Because svn-easy-backup only adds the differences between revisions to an
existing file, rsync will be very bandwidth efficient.

CONFIGURATION
=============

svn-easy-backup assumes that you have number of subversion repositories 
located at a common root:

  /var/svn
    repository_1/
    repository_2/
    ...
    repository_n/

A sample configuration file (in YAML format) might look like this:

--- 
:svn_root: /var/svn
:svnadmin: /usr/bin/svnadmin
:svnlook: /usr/bin/svnlook
:repositories:
:svn_backup: /var/backup/svn
:verbose: false

In this case, subversion repositories will be inspected at /var/svn, and the
resulting dumpfiles will be located at /var/backup/svn.

As new repositories are added, state information about each one will appear in
the :repositories section. 

USAGE
=====

./svn-easy-backup.rb

Currently it must be run in the same directory as its config file, and does
not support any command line options.
